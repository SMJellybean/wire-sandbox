#Decoding A Course Assignment

"*Having trouble finding the point of an assignment prompt? 
You don't have to rely on the few seconds in class when the professor glazes over the assignment components. 
Instead, you can enact your own plan for decoding course assignment prompts and really understanding the key expectations!
Prompts can often be broken down into key components, and learning to quickly but carefully identify them will ensure that you meet all expectations and ace that assignment!*"

This is a brief introduction to the project I selected in the pedagogical mini course: *decoding a course assignment*. 

**Thoughts on the design process:**
- So far I have etablished a few learning outcomes as part of the decoding process: understanding the key output of assignment prompt, identifying key components of an assignment prompt, comparing those components to evaluation expectations, and applying that knowledge to the completion of the assignment. 
- These steps will likely require a breakdown of an abstracted assignment, so I think either a static document pointing out and explaining different portions of an assignment or a short Hype tutorial breaking down the process of identifying key components of an assignment prompt would be the most useful tutorial mediums to pursue. I am leaning towards the the former.
- As I am in the very beginning stages of this process I don't have a prototype to share, but my pedagogy portfolio outlines the design process well and sets the stage for next steps:

**Next Steps:*
My next steps will inlcude: 
- Selecting one of the 4 paths 
- Identifying and articulating the key components of a prompt
- Writing content to describe the breakdown process around these components
- Beginning to assemble relevant images
