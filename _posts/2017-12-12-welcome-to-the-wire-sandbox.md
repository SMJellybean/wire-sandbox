Hi there! Welcome to the WI+RE sandbox! This is our place to play around and experiment with coding and web publishing. We can explore all kinds of things here - coding, editing, html, css, ruby, web animations - you name it!

We may also use this space to do more process oriented posts and share some of our prototypes - we'll see!

For now, let's use this as an opportunity to talk about how posts work.

You'll find the code for this post in the `_posts` directory. Take a look at the code repository at [https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/wire-sandbox) and see if you can find the code for this post.

The code for this post is written in something called markdown, which is kind of like a simplified version of html. We use both markdown and html (and some ruby) in our posts.

Here's a quick [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get you started.
